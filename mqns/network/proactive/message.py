    Swap sequence: nonnegative integers to control swapping order.

    Multiplexing vector, used in buffer-space multiplexing scheme only.

    This list shall have one element per qchannel, i.e. one less than `route`.
    Each element is a pair of nonnegative integers, corresponding to left and right qchannels.
    Each integer indicates how many memory qubits shall be allocated on the left/right qchannel for this path.
    If an integer is zero, it means allocating all qubits assigned to that qchannel for this path.

    Example:
        route = [S,    R,     D]
        m_v   = [ (4,2), (3,0) ]

        S should allocate 4 qubits on S-R channel.
        R should allocate 2 qubits on S-R channel and 3 qubits on R-D channel.
        D should allocate all qubits assigned to R-D channel.

    Each key is a segment name consists of two node names concatenated with a hyphen ("-"),

    Each value is an integer of the required rounds of purification at this segment.
    The default for every segment is zero i.e. no purification is performed.
